# LyfeLineAHSv1

A program I developed for my high school (Allen High School) to educate all 5000 students about vaping, its harmful side effects, and other dangers of nicotine. 
Worked with the principal and district coordinator to launch it full-time at the only high school in our city, allowing students of all ages to get real-time education on what these harmful substances can do to them.
Provides a gamified learning experience, as reading lessons and completing quizzes allows students to earn points which can be redeemed for MINGA points, used during priority for course scheduling, final exam exemptions, and much more!
